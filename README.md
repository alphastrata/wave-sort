# Wave Sort (W-Sort)
This repository contains a Rust implementation of **Wave Sort (W-Sort)**, a novel? in-place sorting algorithm described in the paper ["New Sorting Algorithm Wave Sort (W-Sort)"](https://www.alphaxiv.org/abs/2505.13552).

**Important Note:** This implementation is **not** competitive with high-performance sorting algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort. It was implemented primarily because the concept presented in the research paper was interesting.

## Usage
See the code in the benchmarks/tests, as this is NOT a performant sort it's not going on crates.io
